## Introduction

The Alexandria Library is a group of libraries aimed at electronic design; most libraries focus on KiCAD footprints, but some also contain KiCAD symbol libraries, some contain graphics and some contain STEP/3D model files.

## List of libraries:

### General use

- [**Acheron Symbols**](https://github.com/AcheronProject/acheron_Symbols): KiCAD symbol library;
- [**Acheron Components**](https://github.com/AcheronProject/acheron_Symbols): KiCAD footprint library for general components like integrated circuits, resistors, capacitors, LEDs, inductors, fuses *et cetera*;
- [**Acheron Hardware**](https://github.com/AcheronProject/acheron_Hardware.pretty): KiCAD footprint library for overall interaction hardware like standoffs, encoders, featherboards (Pro Micro, Blue Pill, Black Pill *et cetera*), buttons, battery holders, mounting screws;
- [**Acheron Graphics**](https://github.com/AcheronProject/acheron_Graphics.pretty): KiCAD footprint library for logos, flags, pretty graphics;
- [**Acheron 3D**](https://github.com/AcheronProject/acheron_3D): repository of 3D models used by the footprint libraries;

### Keyboard switch footprints

The libraries listed below are KiCAD footprint libraries for mechanical keyboard switches:

- [**Acheron MX**](https://github.com/AcheronProject/acheron_MX.pretty): exclusive support for MX-type switches;
- [**Acheron MX "Soldermask"**](https://github.com/AcheronProject/acheron_MX_soldermask.pretty): exclusive support for MX-type switches with the frontal pads covered in soldermask, hiding the pads in the front while exposing them on the back for soldering, for aesthetic purposes;
- [**Acheron MXH**](https://github.com/AcheronProject/acheron_MXH.pretty): exclusive support for MX-type switches using Kailh "hotswap" sockets;
- [**Acheron MXH "Metal Rings"**](https://github.com/AcheronProject/acheron_MXH_metalrings.pretty): exclusive support for MX-type switches using Kailh "hotswap" sockets with metallic rings around the switch contacts for aesthetic effect;
- [**Acheron MXA**](https://github.com/AcheronProject/acheron_MXA.pretty): hybrid MX-ALPS footprints;

### Macros, makefiles
- [**Acheron Setup**](https://github.com/AcheronProject/AcheronSetup): makefiles and bash scripts to automate some of the work needed to use and maintain a project based on the Acheron Library
- [**LT2PY**](https://github.com/Gondolindrim/lt2py): Python tool that converts data plots taken from LTSpice into Python plots, allowing to manipulate and edit the plots
